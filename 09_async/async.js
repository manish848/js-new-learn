// Asynchronicity means that if JavaScript has to wait for an operation to complete, it will execute the rest of the code while waiting. Note that JavaScript is single-threaded. This means that it carries out asynchronous operations via the callback queue and event loop.


// read about this that js is syncronus or async language , this is really good to learn and to understand

Blocking code    block the flow of the program  read file sync // and this will read the kernal


non blocking code   do not block the flow of the program  read file async

Asynchronous programming is about concurrency, whereas multithreading is really about parallelism. Asynchronous programming does I/O operations without blocking, whereas multithreading runs several threads at once.
